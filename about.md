Hello! Thanks for stopping by. My name's Joshua. I'm an aerospace engineer, Rubik's Cube solver, and general nerd. I enjoy cooking and baking all kinds of delicious food while listening to a variety of podcasts. I sometimes write collections of words that approximate logical trains of thought. I'm also personal friends with the Creator of the universe. He's very cool.

## FAQ

* What's your best advice for college students?
	* Get a cast iron skillet. You can do everything with them: Cook gravy, fry potatoes, and bake apple pies. Use it as a doorstop. Use it against cockroaches. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS!
  
* I want to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube. Where should I start?
	* First, get a good cube. As with cameras, the best cube is the one you have, but you may eventually want to get a decent speedcube. The [stickerless DaYan TengYun M](https://www.thecubicle.com/collections/dayan/products/dayan-tengyun-m-3x3?variant=18730617962569) is my current main. This [tutorial by JPerm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ron6MN45LY) is a good place to start learning!


* How often should I replace my toothbrush? 
	* If your pet groundhog sees the first bristle fall off the brush, you have six weeks to replace your groundhog. If your groundhog doesn't see the first bristle fall, you're good until a lunar eclipse is visible within a 40-mile radius of your toothbrush. Or just ask your dentist, they'd probably know.

* What is your favorite [Lagrange point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point)?
	* L<sub>2</sub>, for sure. It's mathematically sound, but the idea is still mind-boggling: a point beyond both the Sun and the Earth that stays in lockstep relative to both bodies. Plus, a 2010 article (Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture by Frank Zegler and Bernard Kutter) suggested using it as a propellant depot for interplanetary travel. How cool is that?

* Did you really co-author a paper on pedestrian safety?
	* Yup! You can read it by [clicking here.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cstp.2021.02.009)git
