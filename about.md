Hello! Thanks for stopping by. My name's Joshua. I'm an aerospace engineering student, Rubik's Cube solver, and general nerd. I enjoy cooking and baking all kinds of delicious food while listening to a variety of podcasts. I sometimes write collections of words that approximate logical trains of thought. I'm also personal friends with the Creator of the universe. He's very cool.
