        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I write a personal rendition of &lt;em&gt;My Favorite Things&lt;/em&gt;, podcasts will inevitably be on the list. I listen to them while walking to class, cooking, washing dishes, solving Rubik’s cubes…you get the idea. When executed well, they can transport you to a new world, make you think deeply about a novel idea, or even change your perspective on a topic you thought you knew all about. My feed ranges from economics to theology to design, so you’ll probably find something worth listening to on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tools-of-the-trade&quot;&gt;Tools of the Trade&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dig into the actual podcasts, let’s talk podcast players. This can make or break your entire listening experience, so I suggest you choose wisely. I’ve used two apps in my podcast-listening career, and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-podcasts&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone, this gets the job done. It does the basics well: subscribe, listen, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search on Apple Podcasts is incredibly powerful. You can browse for new shows easily, see the guests on an episode (and very handily, what other podcasts they’ve appeared in), and even search for topics within the audio. Audio search is still in beta and I believe guest listings are at the behest of the podcast publisher, but still useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video support. Some podcasts will very rarely do video specials. Not many players are built to handle it, but Apple Podcasts does.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explicit playback tagging. Depending on how you feel about explicit content, this could be very handy. This ties in directly to your content playback settings for the phone as a whole, so if you’ve designated explicit content as off-limits, Apple Podcasts will just grey the episode out. If you don’t have those settings enabled, you will at the very least see a little “E” tag by the episode title.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iTunes U integration. If you’re already on the platform, Apple Podcasts steps right in sync. If not, this doesn’t apply to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The user interface. Let’s start at the bottom. Why is there a “Listen Now” and a “Library” tab? Couldn’t all my episodes be listed in one neat, orderly place? Why does the Library tab separate out Downloaded Episodes (this is a design choice that carries over into the Music app as well, and I don’t like it.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap an episode to play. There were so many times I scrolled through a podcast’s feed only for a finger to hold too long on the screen and start playing a random episode. This makes sense for a music library, but podcasts aren’t music. Plus, you’ve probably listened to the music in your collection and know what you’re getting into. On the other hand, you’re probably listening to a podcast episode for the first and only time. Episodes typically have several paragraphs of show notes that you’d probably want to glance through. If you think I’m getting worked up about this unnecessarily, consider this. If you’re browsing a streaming service for movies online and you tap just the cover image, would you rather start playing the movie immediately, or read more details first? I prefer the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything I don’t like about Apple Podcasts is purely due to design. And when something isn’t designed well, it loses much of its functional value. Back in the day, a 4-year-old could pick up an iPhone and do anything simply because the interface was designed so well. Now, I feel like I’m digging through features which might be useful but are keeping me from what I want to do - listen to podcasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overcast&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s when I switched to Overcast. This is, in my mind, the gold standard of podcast players and I’ve used it exclusively since March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros-1&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One main home screen. Seriously, the rest of the app could be nigh unusable and I would probably still use it for this reason. The whole point of a podcast player is the podcasts. Overcast puts your feed front and center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individual podcast feed design. Once you’ve selected a podcast, the episodes are right there. You know exactly which ones you’ve played, which ones are downloaded, which ones are streaming. You don’t need a separate tab for downloaded content. (&lt;em&gt;cough Apple Podcasts cough&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tapping an episode doesn’t autoplay. This comes with a caveat: you have to set this up first. On the plus side, it’s a single switch to flip. Painless and easy. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Playback features. None of these are required, but they make the experience so much better. Voice Boost does exactly what the package says. Smart Speed shortens silences (sounds dumb, but it’s eliminated 22 hours of dead space in the episodes I’ve listened to in the past 8 months). Smart Seek adjust rewind/fast-forward to fall between words rather than exactly where you skipped to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can share with all my friends! I could never share episodes from Apple Podcasts with non-Apple friends, which is terrible. Overcast has share links that go to a webpage instead, where users can choose to play in-browser or in a different podcast app of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons-1&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My phone doesn’t auto-lock when the app is active. I don’t know if this is a bug or a design choice, but I’ll start playing an episode, start cooking, and come back 30 minutes later to find my screen was on the whole time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No explicit playback tags. Apple Podcasts wins this round, but I don’t listen to podcasts that feature this kind of language anyway. As a result, if there is an outlier episode where a guest drops a swear word or two, the hosts either a) censor it or b) warn you up front.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No video support. This isn’t a dealbreaker; most podcasts don’t do video. If they do, it’s likely they also have a separate feed on YouTube, FaceBook, Vimeo, or another platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple’s search is far superior to Overcast’s. But I typically rely on other sources to recommend new shows, so I don’t mind too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that being said, I should note that Overcast has a development team of…one. That’s it. One man, Marco Arment, singlehandedly created the best podcast player available. Any bugs are slowly but surely being ironed out and new features are still being added. Overcast is a win for the little guy, and I am all for the little guy. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (For the record, this isn’t an ad. I just really, really like Overcast!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-favorite-podcasts&quot;&gt;My Favorite Podcasts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about ranking these shows but quickly realized I’d never actually finish writing this article if I did that. So these shows are presented alphabetically, along with a selection of specific episodes I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that I don’t listen to every episode of these shows. There are many whose message I’ve disagreed with and many that I stop listening to mere seconds in. But at the end of the day, I still respect the creators for the work they put into their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;13-minutes-to-the-moon&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2/episodes/downloads&quot;&gt;13 Minutes to the Moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chill-inducing, jaw-dropping retelling of the final approach of the Apollo 11 mission. Released in the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, &lt;em&gt;13 Minutes to the Moon&lt;/em&gt; tells you the stories behind THE story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+RkpqaSRJk&quot;&gt;Kids in control&lt;/a&gt;: The kids who made the moon landing possible.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+RkpqPEEn0&quot;&gt;The 13 minutes&lt;/a&gt;: The actual CapCom feed from the final minutes of the July 20, 1969 landing. You should only listen to this if you’ve heard the other 10 episodes first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;99-invisible&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://99percentinvisible.org/&quot;&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single greatest podcast on design. Don’t care about design? Listen to 99PI anyway. You will certainly care about design. They talk about everything from Los Angeles road signage to Spanish lotteries to British nautical reports to Canadian basketball jerseys to beekeeping. This is easily one of my all-time favorites and I can’t say enough good things about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-1&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+DCmXPIw&quot;&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;: The beauty of the Brazilian soccer jersey, and how its design transcended even international borders.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+DDWSdro&quot;&gt;In the Same Ballpark&lt;/a&gt;: I don’t even like baseball, but this episode on stadium design is fascinating.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+DDWgge8&quot;&gt;La Sagrada Familia&lt;/a&gt;: The story of an architect’s unfinished Gothic cathedral…from the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;between-the-grooves&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faithstrongtoday.com/betweenthegrooves&quot;&gt;Between the Grooves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A podcast discussing the Christian music industry and interviewing Christian artists. A niche genre, perhaps, but a fantastic listen nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-2&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+I6p5NX9Ko&quot;&gt;Do Great Art and Be Found Faithful with Nicole C. Mullen&lt;/a&gt;: If you’ve never heard Nicole C. Mullen’s music, you’re missing out. This episode goes beyond the music and into the heart with some incredible wisdom for anyone who interacts with Christian music on any level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bible-project&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebibleproject.com/&quot;&gt;The Bible Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Bible nerd and a storyteller discuss the greatest book ever written. TBP makes incredible videos walking you through different books of the Bible, themes, and central ideas that make the Bible “a unified story that leads to Jesus.” The podcast is the collection of discussions that eventually culminated in these videos. If you were raised in the church, they have an uncanny knack for revealing new truths in texts you’ve read a million times before. If you’ve never read the Bible before, they walk through the Bible at a level anyone can understand. If I could only listen to one Bible-focused podcast for the rest of my life, it would probably be this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-3&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+InpLs-kKk&quot;&gt;The Exile and the Wisdom Warrior&lt;/a&gt;: This one is my favorite for deeply personal reasons. It’s a clarion call to a new way of life.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+InpL-sHFc&quot;&gt;The Snake in the Throne Room&lt;/a&gt;: This series on the Son of Man had me convinced I had never read the book of Genesis. 
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+InpIAYJHg&quot;&gt;Power Over the Snake&lt;/a&gt;: “Son of Man” was the title Jesus used most frequently to describe Himself. He came to finish what humanity could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kris-vallotton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krisvallotton.com/&quot;&gt;Kris Vallotton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy is nuts. Kris communicates the Bible like no one else I know. He’s funny, thought-provoking, and convicts deeply. I re-listen to these episodes regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-4&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+Cgw5CUKk&quot;&gt;Secrets to a Great Marriage&lt;/a&gt;: Are you married? Listen to this? Are you unmarried? Listen to this. I played this one 3 times over within 24 hours of hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-memory-palace&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thememorypalace.us/&quot;&gt;the memory palace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best short stories about history you’ll never find in a textbook, committed to audio. Nate DiMeo brings figures from the past into real life like no one else. There’s a reason these episodes run 10-15 minutes - there would be no way to process everything you just heard if it went any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-5&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+FtC5PU7bM&quot;&gt;If You Have to be a Floor&lt;/a&gt;: the memory palace reveals nothing but credits in its show notes, so I will honor that tradition here. All I can say is that you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; hear this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passion-city-churchpassion-city-church-dc&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://passioncitychurch.com/&quot;&gt;Passion City Church/Passion City Church DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sermons from the ATL and Washington D.C. Louie Giglio has been around for a while, spearheading the Passion Conference movement, and Ben Stuart, one of my favorite communicators, is carrying the torch in the nation’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-6&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+FoSL-Y3ec&quot;&gt;The Restoration of Peter&lt;/a&gt;: A powerful look at the betrayal and redemption of one of the most vocal disciples in the gospels. Ben Stuart shows us the Peter inside us all.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+FoSIiZvWg&quot;&gt;The Sovereignty of God in the Chaos of Christmas&lt;/a&gt;: The greatest Christmas message ever told. I listen to this at least annually (mostly during the holidays, but I’ve been known to play it in May as well). Louie Giglio deconstructs the context of the Christmas story in a way you’ve never heard before but desperately need in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planet-money&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, interesting stories on the economy in America and beyond. If you’ve never cared about helium harvesting or Venmo refunds, now you will!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-7&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HuIhCkYqU&quot;&gt;We’re Going to Space&lt;/a&gt;: The intersection of economics and space. I love this so much.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HuIge-Wm0&quot;&gt;Wait, Why Are We Going to Space?&lt;/a&gt;: You generally need a good reason to go to space. This isn’t a trip to Walmart, after all. 
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HuIgOW7gE&quot;&gt;Rocket Shopping&lt;/a&gt;: Step 1: Find a satellite. Done. Step 2: Find a launch vehicle.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HuIg-rNBs&quot;&gt;3 2 1&lt;/a&gt;: The countdown. The launch. The space nerd inside of me rejoices.
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HuIicDKPc&quot;&gt;Why The Price of Coke Didn’t Change For 70 years&lt;/a&gt;: The title made me say, “Wait, really?” The story made me say, “Wow.” A fascinating look at the world’s most famous beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sleeping-at-last-podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sleepingatlast.podbean.com/&quot;&gt;The Sleeping At Last Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever listened to a song and wondered, “How did they make that?” Ryan O’Neal answers all of those questions about the music he produces under the name Sleeping At Last. I’ve always loved this concept for a podcast and Ryan knocks it out of the park. Updates are spotty because of the nature of music production, but man, the wait is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-8&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+OHH8fBcwk&quot;&gt;August 21, 2017: Total Solar Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;: Ryan O’Neal is just as much of a space nerd as I am and has been making music dedicated to various astronomical events. In this one, he scores the first solar eclipse over the United States in almost 40 years. An amazing behind-the-scenes look that leaves you with a deep appreciation for artists and the heart they pour into their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twenty-thousand-hertz&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.20k.org/&quot;&gt;Twenty Thousand Hertz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after the upper limit of the human hearing range, 20K tells the stories of the sounds we hear. Yes, it’s very meta, but it’s so well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-this-9&quot;&gt;Listen to This:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HhScw4Ppk&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/a&gt;: Yet another podcast about space. Are you surprised? But wait, there’s no sound in space…or is there? 
-&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+HhSe3hEII&quot;&gt;Sonic Seasoning&lt;/a&gt;: A surprising look at the connection between sound and taste. You should probably listen to this one with some chocolate handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of audio. I don’t expect anyone (besides myself) to listen to all of these. But if you do listen to any of these episodes, please reach out to me and tell me what you think! Did you like it? Hate it? I want to hear it all. And I love discovering great new shows, so send me your recommendations as well!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Solving Phun-bos</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve met me, you know I like space. The infinite nature of the universe, our smallness in comparison, the unending possibilities of discovery. You also know I like Rubik’s cubes. On a smaller scale, the cube is equally infinite. There are over 43 quintillion permutations of the 3x3 cube, a set of possible states far beyond what any human is capable of reaching in a thousand lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not combine the two? Kenneth Brandon, a YouTuber/cuber under the handle RedKB, designed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2uIrAUhsXk&quot;&gt;custom cube&lt;/a&gt; by 3D printing his company’s logo with a hole in the middle just big enough for a 2x2 cube internally. This inspired me to create my own edition of a custom 3D printed cube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aim-for-the-moon&quot;&gt;Aim for the Moon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one is to select a planetary body as the basis for my model. I chose Phobos, the larger of Mars’ two moons. I had a few reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any ordinary planet would be indistinguishable from another in a 3D print of this scale. All the other planets are basically spheres, so you would have few interesting features on the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phobos has a massive crater named Stickney that is incredibly interesting in its own right. But for our purposes, it’s a unique feature that would be cool to render in a 3D model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My senior design team is currently designing a mission to Phobos. It’s a fascinating satellite that we don’t know a lot about and I’ve grown to love it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phobos looks like a potato. Who doesn’t like potatoes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Stickney.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stickney is the massive cavity on the side of Phobos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181125.html&quot;&gt;Credit: Viking Project, JPL, NASA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roll-model&quot;&gt;Roll Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to begin the modeling process. RedKB’s procedure was to create the logo he wanted, extrude it out, cut a hole out for the cube in the center, and split it across the three planes (XY, XZ, and YZ) to allow rotation. Unfortunately, Phobos isn’t a 2D shape that can be easily extruded upwards from a sketch. However, there are many models already available for use! I found mine &lt;a href=&quot;https://3d-asteroids.space/moons/M1-Phobos&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This website has many different models of Phobos with varying resolutions. I chose the lowest fidelity for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t know how good the 3D printer I would use is. Having a hyper-accurate rendition of Phobos wouldn’t be useful if the printer couldn’t capture the resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The higher fidelity models nearly broke SOLIDWORKS, the modeling software I was using. There were simply too many individual features that couldn’t be efficiently rendered even on the virtual machine I was running the software on. This would have been fine if I just needed to run it once, save the file, and call it a day. But I needed to manipulate and cut the model, and every minor change would take several minutes to run. That compounded if I made a mistake and had to undo and redo everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loaded up the Thomas model from the previously referenced link and this is what that looks like. I resized it to something I thought was reasonable and ended up with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phobos_Render.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stickney Crater is visible on the right side of the body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s nice, but that’s just a solid body. So I sketched a square and extruded it into a cube at the center of Phobos. Then I told SOLIDWORKS to subtract the cube from Phobos and just like that, I have a cube-shaped hole in the middle. The specifics of the size of the hole will depend on the model of 2x2 used in the center of the cube. I chose the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecubicle.com/collections/2x2/products/z-mini-2x2-keychain-cube&quot;&gt;Z Mini 2x2 Keychain Cube&lt;/a&gt; from The Cubicle. (This isn’t a sponsored post, I just like The Cubicle!) It had a few advantages. For one, it’s very cheap. Second, it’s very small - at 35mm to a side, it lets me print a slightly smaller puzzle. Remember, the actual size of the puzzle will be much larger than the 2x2 used in the center, so minimizing this will result in a more manageable size overall. Also, the keychain itself is removable, so I’ve got no concerns with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phobos_Cutout.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t see this in the images above, but Phobos is split across the three planes in order to create 8 unique parts. Every part is slightly different on the outside, but that’s the beauty of it! Finally, we have to polish up each of the pieces. Long-time cubers will remember when every piece on the cube was square and blocky. This made them useless for cubing. So I went through each piece and rounded each corner that would interact with another piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little tricky to do on corners in SOLIDWORKS, but I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.solidworks.com/thread/208044&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; to be useful. In a nutshell, select all the edges leading to a given vertex, then select Fillet. Set the actual fillet to be something very small, almost nonexistent. Then set the Setback Parameter to be what you’d like the actual radius of curvature of the vertex to be. In my case, I used a fillet of 0.001 mm and a Setback Parameter of 3mm. Click the vertex to apply it to, then Set All, and save the fillet. That does it quite nicely. Repeat for all eight pieces, and you’re good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phobos_Piece.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whaddya mean, we don’t know what the interior of Phobos is like? I’ve got it right here!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, export every piece to an STL file and head to your nearest 3D printer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;printing-a-moon&quot;&gt;Printing a Moon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fun part. The Aerospace Engineering department at Georgia Tech has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://ae.gatech.edu/aero-maker-space&quot;&gt;Aero Maker Space&lt;/a&gt; for student use, including 3D printers. I headed there, submitted my print, and that was that. By the next day, I had a beautiful print ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phobos_Print.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note that my filleted corners were underwhelming, to say the least. If I repeated the process, I would make my fillets much larger than 3mm. This may take some trial and error, but I’m satisfied for now. The 2x2 cube arrived a few days after the print, which meant I had everything I needed to assemble the puzzle. The cube doesn’t turn very well - understandable, given that it was built as a novelty keychain toy, not a speed cube. Loosening the tensions on the core helped, but it was still pretty rough. A friend provided some cube lubricant to help with the internal friction and I went back to the AE Maker Space in search of some super glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-the-pieces-together&quot;&gt;Putting the Pieces Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started gluing, I sanded each face of the cube down with some 220 grit sandpaper to help with adherence. Then a dot of glue went onto each face a given piece of the cube before applying the printed piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phobos_Assembly.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Five pieces glued, three to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, I was done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Phinished.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We’re - ahem - phinished!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the pieces aren’t uniform, scrambling results in all kinds of strange shapes. For example, here’s what a Sune algorithm looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Solving_Phunbos/Sune_Case.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dayan TengYun M for scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phinal-thoughts&quot;&gt;Phinal Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an enjoyable project. If I could have changed anything, it would have been to fillet the corners more. There’s still a lot of catching so you have to make sure each piece is lined up perfectly before you rotate. Of course, this is more of a decorative piece than a competition-worthy speed cube, so I’m not terribly disappointed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this was a cool project to work on! And since Phobos is such a dark and gloomy name, I hereby christen my new puzzle “Phunbos”!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cubing Data Analysis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like solving Rubik’s cubes. I have one within 20 feet of myself at all times (a bit of an exaggeration, but pretty close to the truth). Here’s a picture of me with Erno Rubik, the inventor of the cube!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Erno.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s a very nice person. Anyways, I’ve been solving for years, and I finally asked the question: “Have I improved?” Over the years, I’ve amassed a collection of several thousand solves. My dataset includes timestamps, solve times, scrambles used (when available), and averages. My friend/fellow nerd Jacob suggested I use Python to poke at my data and see what came out. I had some previous coding experience, but none with Python, so I had no idea what I was getting into. Turns out, Python is a pretty friendly language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After importing the data to a Jupyter notebook, I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;box-it-up&quot;&gt;Box It Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cubing, when people ask, “How fast are you?”, there are two ways to respond. One is to give your fastest single solve. Another is to say, “I am sub-x.” Here, x is a neat whole number like 60, 30, 20, 15, etc. This means in general that over an arbitrary set of solves, your average time will be below that cutoff. For example, I currently consider myself sub-20, moving towards sub-15. But am I actually sub-20? I was curious about what percentage of my times fit into which boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was to parse through the data and split the data based on date. Everything in a given past year was lumped into one group, and everything in the present year was split by months. This meant I could quickly see how I had improved from 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and how progress was going throughout 2019. Then I categorized the times by my arbitrary cutoffs: Sub-60, -45, -30, -25, -20, and -15. For example, if a solve was between 30-60 seconds, it was sub-60. All my data would fit into one of these boxes. Since every month or year had a variable number of solves, I normalized the data to give me percentages. After some &lt;del&gt;very professional&lt;/del&gt; amateur coding, I came up with this graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/output_2_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you’ll notice that sub-60 times aren’t visible. Rest assured, they are there! They simply vanished after the first few months of data from late 2016 into early 2017. You’ll notice I rapidly improved over the first few years, but progress in 2019 has slowed. That’s because as I get faster, the room for improvement shrinks. I have to optimize specific aspects of my solve that don’t become immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-20 times started arriving in 2017 but didn’t become the majority of solves until early this year. As of this post, roughly 75% of my solves are below 20 seconds. That’s good enough for me to call myself sub-20! There are some significant peaks and valleys through the later part of this year, mostly due to the fact that I didn’t have a ton of solves in those months and minor mistakes can very quickly look like unscalable peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of this graph is the blip of sub-15 times in 2018 turning into a noticeable chunk in 2019. Granted, they make up a small portion of the data, but they are there and they are growing! One of my biggest cubing goals is to confidently call myself sub-15. That means I expect to see what is a little notch now grow to dominate the rest of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;another-day-another-solve&quot;&gt;Another Day, Another Solve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cubers (and humans in general) tend to fixate on personal bests, but I wanted to know something a little different. On any given day that I cubed, what was my best time of that day alone? My best time on July 9, 2017, might have been 27.81s, but I might have had a best time of 32.33s three days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was pretty easy to implement. For every day in the data set, I picked the first time and made it the best time of the day. Then I kept going until either a) I started a new day or b) I found a better time. The end result looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/output_3_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in the recent past, I am likely to have at least one time under 15 seconds and almost guaranteed to have a solve under 20. This is encouraging! It means my best is getting better on a consistent basis. You’ll notice the graph appears to be tapering off, but I don’t think this is my limit. I know of several ways to improve my times (I’ve begun implementing them) but results take time to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-of-the-best&quot;&gt;Best of the Best&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next section is fairly self-explanatory. How have my all-time bests improved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation is super easy. Start with the first recorded solve, and make that your “best”. Then go through each solve after that. If you find something better, add it to the list. Keep on going until you hit the end. Finally, you get this result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/output_4_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this to be one of my favorite visualizations. I very quickly drop my best time from over 35 seconds to under 25, and I never look back. The biggest drawback is that the x-axis isn’t spaced by date properly; they’re spaced evenly which isn’t how these solves are set. That’s something to be fixed at a later date. Regardless, the trend is visible. My second major cubing goal is to have one solve under 10 seconds. If I can achieve that, I’ve joked, I’ll retire happy. And by the looks of it, I’m not too far off! I recently broke the sub-10.5 barrier (super arbitrary, I know, but you take your wins where you can) with a time of 10.46 seconds. I never imagined a day where I would be on the precipice of reaching my biggest cubing goal, yet here we are. So close! This makes me want to pick up a cube and just keep solving because you never know when a personal best will strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scorigami&quot;&gt;Scorigami!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is a little silly, but I find it pretty cool. Jon Bois is a sports writer/data nerd. He created the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5C8cGMueY&quot;&gt;scorigami&lt;/a&gt;, defined as “the art of achieving a final score in an NFL game that has never happened before.” For example, in 2019, the Ravens beat the Dolphins 59-10, a score that had never occurred in the NFL prior. Of course, I wanted to apply this to cubing. Times are measured in hundredths of seconds (timers used in competition aren’t yet good enough to measure milliseconds). For example, between 8.00 and 9.00 seconds, there are 100 possible unique times. I wanted to know how many I had reached between my worst and best times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done by finding the set of all unique times I had achieved and subtracting it from the set of all possible unique times between my best and worst solves. I also wanted to know how many of my times had only been reached once (for example, my personal best has only been achieved once). The code whirred away in the background for a while and gave me these results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    Between my best time of 10.46 s and my worst time of 58.15 s, there are 4769 possible unique times.
    Unique times are discretely measured in units of 0.01s. One term used to describe specific rare instances of a score is scorigami, invented by Jon Bois.
    I have achieved 2245 of them. This is 47.07 % of all possible scorigami times.
    The time that appears the most frequently is 20.52 s.
    There are 601 times that occur only once. These are true scorigamis. They had never been done before and have not been achieved since.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was very interesting to me. I’ve reached less than 50% of this set of unique times. This makes sense; in the early days, I was improving rapidly, so I very quickly stopped having very slow times. Later, as I stabilized, I started getting more and more of the same solve times and only occasionally delving into new territory. Again, this means absolutely nothing, but it’s still fun to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s my journey through cubing data! I still have a few things that I’d like to do, listed below. Primarily I’d like to run this same analysis on my averages of 100 solves. This is a better indicator of how consistent (or inconsistent) my solves have been over the last few years. A couple of things need to be tweaked here and there, like the axes on some graphs, but this is it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go solve a cube. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todo&quot;&gt;TODO:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-evaluator-for-ao5-12-100-etc-to-be-implemented&quot;&gt;Progress evaluator for Ao5, 12, 100, etc.: To be implemented&lt;/h3&gt;
